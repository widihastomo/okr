# ✅ Deployment Successfully Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. MODULE_NOT_FOUND Error
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript files with tsx dependency via subprocess spawn
- **Solution**: Direct require() execution instead of spawn() for better module resolution
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED**

### 2. Internal Server Error
- **Root Cause**: Port conflicts and frontend path issues
- **Solution**: Enhanced port retry logic and corrected static file paths
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED**

### 3. Production Server Startup
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect path configuration for frontend serving
- **Solution**: Fixed paths from `dist/server/public/` to `dist/public/`
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED**
