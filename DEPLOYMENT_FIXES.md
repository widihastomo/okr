# Deployment Configuration Fixes

## ✅ Port Configuration - FIXED

**Issue:** Server was using hardcoded port 5000 instead of environment PORT variable
**Fix Applied:** Updated server to use `process.env.PORT || 5000`
**Status:** Working correctly

## Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### 1. Build Process Issues
- **Problem:** Build timeout or memory issues during `npm run build`
- **Solution:** Use incremental builds or build caching

### 2. Environment Variables
- **Problem:** Missing required environment variables in production
- **Solution:** Ensure DATABASE_URL is set in deployment environment

### 3. Static File Serving
- **Problem:** Static files not served correctly in production
- **Solution:** Verified static file serving is properly configured

### 4. Health Check Configuration
- **Problem:** Deployment health checks failing
- **Solution:** Added immediate-response `/health` endpoint

## Current Configuration Status

✅ Port: Uses environment PORT variable with fallback to 5000
✅ Host: Binds to 0.0.0.0 for proper external access
✅ Health Check: `/health` endpoint responds immediately
✅ Database: PostgreSQL connection configured
✅ Static Files: Production serving configured
✅ Process Management: Graceful shutdown handlers

## Deployment Command Verification

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

All commands working correctly.
