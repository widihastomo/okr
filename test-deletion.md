# Test Plan Deletion Fix

## Problem
- Subscription plan deletion failed due to foreign key constraint
- Error: "billing_periods_plan_id_fkey" constraint violation
- Need to delete billing periods before deleting subscription plan

## Solution Implemented
1. Updated DELETE /api/admin/subscription-plans/:id endpoint
2. Added cascade deletion: billing periods â†’ subscription plan
3. Maintained data integrity checks for active organization subscriptions

## Test Steps
1. Try to delete a subscription plan that has billing periods
2. Verify it deletes billing periods first
3. Verify it then deletes the subscription plan
4. Verify proper error handling for plans in use

## Expected Result
- Subscription plan deletion should work without foreign key constraint errors
- System should maintain data integrity by checking for active subscriptions first
